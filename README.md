### Just a little more about me

ðŸ”­ I am working on a clustering project to determine which customers is able to participate of a loyalty program.

ðŸŒ± By now I am studying data science, math for data science, web scraping, machine learning models, embedding.

ðŸ˜„ **Denny** is not a Brazilian name, then I need to spell it everywhere but even so I am regularly called as Dener, Denis, Deni, etc.

âš¡ You should to know that I love playing (video games, boarding games, chess) as much as I love traveling and programming.
