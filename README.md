# Hello, world! Welcome to my desk!

## Just a little about me!

ðŸ”­ I am working on a clustering project to determine which customers is able to participate of a loyalty program.

ðŸŒ± By now I am studying data science, math for data science, web scraping, machine learning models, embedding.

ðŸ˜„ Fun Fact: **Denny** is not a Brazilian name, then I need to spell it everywhere but even so I am regularly called as Dener, Denis, Deni, etc.

âš¡ You should to know: I love playing (video games, boarding games, chess) as much as I love traveling and programming.

<!-- Projects -->
## Take a look at my projects!

### [House Rocket](https://github.com/daSpinelli/Python-Zero-DS)
This project provides insights through an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a database from a company that buys and sells houses in Seattle WA, EUA.
I used:
- Python to build all the EDA;
- Heroku to deploy;
- And the Streamlit to navigate through the results.


### [Rossmann](https://github.com/daSpinelli/dsEmProd)
This project creates an machine learning model to predict the sales for the next 6 months from a multi store company.
I used:
- Python to build all the EDA and modeling;
- XGBoost was the machine learning model chosen;
- Heroku to deploy;
- A bot telegram to access the result of prediction.

### [Super Customers](#) (In progress...)
This project will result in clusters (groups) of customers in a database from an e-commerce company.
The goal of clustering this customers is to find out the ones who is able to participate of a loyalty program, the super customers.
I used:
- Python to build clustering and all the EDA;
- Random Forest Regressor as embedding;
- Gaussian Mixture Model was the machine learning model chosen.

I will use:
- Heroku or AWS to deploy;
- Power Bi or Tableu to navigate through the results.


This project is still in progress in my GitLab. As soon as I finish it I will push it here.
